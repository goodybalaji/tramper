Tramper is a personal project which focused primarily on the audio rendering of the popular document formats. I decided recently after about 3 years to give it to anybody could be interested.

This desktop application plays the podcats, read webpages thanks to a speech synthesizer, plays the embedded media (music and video).
An address bar allows you to type an URL or launch a research with the main online search engines, like Google or Wikipedia.
Manage your favorites, keep an history of your researches and surfs.
A miniature of your current documents is displayed in each tab.
The window can be splitted into 2 horizontal or vertical resizable parts (for example, a feed on the left, a webpage on the right).
Tramper has a basic coverage of audio CSS styles.

Tramper has some assistive features for visually impaired people:
  * plays a music while a progress bar is running
  * says the word you just typed in a textfield/textarea
  * says the text you selected in a textfield/textarea
  * says the label of the button you pressed
  * says the info/warning/error messages displayed in popup windows with a sound.
  * says the tooltips messages
  * says the label of the selected nodes in a tree
  * says the items hovered by the mouse, in a dropdown box and a list
